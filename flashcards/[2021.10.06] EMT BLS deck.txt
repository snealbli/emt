What are two particularly dangerous medical emergencies that result from ascent emergencies?	"These are air embolisms and decompression sickness (aka ""the bends"")."	32 definition emergencies environmental injury
What is an air embolism?	This is a condition involving bubbles of air in the blood vessels. They can occur on a dive as shallow as 6'. The problem starts when the diver holds his or her breath during a rapid ascent. The air pressure in the lungs remains at a high level while the external pressure on the chest decreases. As a result, the air inside the lungs expand rapidly, causing the alveoli in the lungs to rupture.	32 definition emergencies environmental injury

What is decompression sickness (aka the bends)?	This occurs when bubbles of gas, especially nitrogen, obstruct the blood vessels. It results from too rapid an ascent from a dive, too long of a dive at too deep a depth, or repeated dives on the same day without the proper time intervals. During the dive, nitrogen that is being breathed dissolves in the blood and tissues because it is under pressure. When the diver ascends, the external pressure is decreased, and the dissolved nitrogen forms small bubbles within those tissues.	32 definition emergencies environmental injury
What is the most striking symptom regarding decompression sickness?	"The most striking symptom of this is joint pain so severe that the patient literally doubles up, or ""bends""."	32 definition emergencies environmental injury

What is breath-holding syncope?	This is a loss of consciousness caused by a decreased stimulus for breathing. This happens to swimmers who breathe in and out rapidly and deeply before entering the water in an effort to expand their capacity to stay underwater. Whereas this technique increases the swimmer's oxygen level, the hyperventilation involved lowers the carbon dioxide level. Because an elevated level of carbon dioxide in the blood is the strongest stimulus for breathing, the swimmer may not feel the need to breathe even after using up all the oxygen in his or her lungs.	32 definition emergencies environmental injury

As a result, the anxillary nerve may be compressed, causing a numb patch on the outer aspect of the shoulder. Be sure to document this finding.</div>	31 anatomy definition injury orthopaedic trauma
Why is stabilizing an anterior shoulder dislocation difficult?	This is difficult because any attempt to bring the arm in toward the chest will produce pain. You must splint the joint in whatever position is most comfortable for the patient, so if necessary, place a pillow or rolled blanket or towels between the arm and chest to fill up the space between them.	31 anatomy definition injury orthopaedic trauma

Low fluid volume (caused by: trauma to vessels or tissues, and fluid loss from GI tract),</div><div>and,</div><div>3. Poor vessel function (caused by: infection, drug overdose, spinal cord injuries, and anaphylaxis).</div>	12 causes definition shock
What does pump failure cause?	Cardiogenic and obstructive shock are caused by this kind of failure.	12 definition shock
What kinds of shock does poor vessel function cause?	Distributive shock, septic shock, neurogenic shock, anaphylactic shock, and psychogenic shock are caused by this kind of failure.	12 shock
What kinds of shock does low fluid volume cause?	Hypovolemic shock, hemorrhagic shock, and nonhemorrhagic shock are caused by this kind of failure.	12 shock
What causes cardiogenic shock?	This is caused by inadequate functioning of the heart, or pump failure.	12 causes definition shock
What is edema?	This is the presence of abnormally large amounts of fluid between cells in body tissues, causing swelling of the affected area.	12 definition shock
When does cardiogenic shock develop?	This develops when the heart cannot maintain sufficient output (or cardiac output) to meet the demands of the body.	12 shock
What is myocardial contractility?	This is the ability for the heart to contract.	12 definition shock
What is preload?	This is the precontraction pressure in the heart as the volume of blood builds up.	12 definition shock
What is afterload?	This is the force or resistance against which the heart pumps.	12 definition shock
What is obstructive shock?	This results when conditions that cause mechanical obstruction of the cardiac muscle also impact pump function.	12 definition shock
What are two of the most common examples of obstructive shock?	Two of the most common examples of this are cardiac tamponade and tension pneumothorax.	12 definition shock
What is a cardiac tamponade (A.K.A. a pericardial tamponade)?	This is a collection of fluid between the pericardial sac and the myocardium. It is caused by blunt or penetrating trauma and can progress rapidly.	12 definition shock
What happens during a cardiac tamponade?	When this occurs, blood leaks into the tough fibrous membrane known as the pericardium, causing an accumulation of blood within the pericardial sac. This accumulation leads to compression of the heart. Because the pericardium has a limited ability to stretch, each contraction of the heart allows more blood accumulation between the heart and the sac. The accumulated blood prevents the heart from opening up to allow complete refilling.	12 bleeding cardiovascular definition emergencies injury shock
What are the signs and symptoms of cardiac tamponade?	The signs and symptoms of this are referred to as Beck's Triad. They are:<div>1) Jugular vein distention.</div><div>2) Muffled heart sounds,</div><div>and</div><div>3) The merging of systolic and diastolic blood pressure.&nbsp;</div>	12 definition shock signs symptoms
What causes tension pneumothorax?	This is caused by damage to the lung tissue. This damage allows air normally held within the lung to escape into the chest cavity. If this condition is allowed to continue untreated, a sufficient amount of air will accumulate within the chest cavity and begin applying pressure to the structures in the mediastinum. The trapped air begins to shift the chest organs toward the uninjured side, which creates the condition.	12 causes definition shock
What is distributive shock?	This is when there is widespread dilation of the small arterioles, small venules, or both.	12 definition shock
What is septic shock?	This is a result of severe infections, usually bacterial, in which toxins are generated by the bacteria or by infected body tissues; the toxins damage the vessel walls, causing increased cellular permeability. The vessel walls leak and are unable to contract well. Widespread dilation of vessels, in combination with plasma loss through the injured vessel walls, resulting in shock.	12 definition shock
What is usually the cause of neurogenic shock?	This is usually caused by damage to the spinal cord, particularly at the upper cervical level, which damages the part of the nervous system that controls the size and muscular tone of the blood vessels.	12 definition shock
What is an important consideration in patients in neurogenic shock?	One important consideration in these kinds of patients is that these patients lack the ability to regulate body temperature.	12 definition shock

What should you remember about blood pressure drops in children and infants?	Remember that these patients can maintain their blood pressure until they have lost more than half their blood volume. By the time their blood pressure drops in shock, they are close to death.	12 pediatric shock
Which conditions in patients should make you suspect shock?	You should expect this if a patient has any one of the following conditions:<div>Multiple severe fractures,</div><div>Abdominal or chest injury,</div><div>Spinal injury,</div><div>A severe infection,</div><div>A major heart attack,</div><div>And,</div><div>Anaphylaxis.</div>	12 shock

What is COPD?	"This is when patients have difficulty eliminating carbon dioxide through exhalation; thus, they always have higher levels of carbon dioxide. This potentially alters their drive for breathing. The body uses a ""backup system"", the hypoxic drive, to control breathing. This is different from the primary control of breathing that uses carbon dioxide. Caution should be taken when administering high concentrations of oxygen to these kinds of patients, as providing high concentrations of oxygen over time will increase the amount of oxygen dissolved in plasma; this could potentially negatively affect their body's drive to breathe."	10 airway definition respiratory
