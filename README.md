## Additional info
1. Textbook notes are coded in [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX "TeX").  \
    I personally use [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/ "LaTeX made comfortable") for editing, but [any TeX editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_TeX_editors "Comparison of TeX editors") should work.

2.  Flashcards are tagged for both chapter number _and_ content, with usage by [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/ "Powerful, intelligent flash cards.") in mind. 
    Flashcards should work with almost [any flashcard program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_flashcard_software "List of flashcard software") though.
